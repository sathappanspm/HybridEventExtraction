\section{Conclusion}
We have presented an event encoding system for Military Action and Non-state actor events as well as for Civil Unrest events. Specifically we built a system to minimize human effort and to judiciously decide suitable human-machine combinations to yield high performance. The  innovative aspects of our system are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hybrid Event encoding wherein the machine learning system decides for which documents and which fields human supervision is required.
    \item State-of-art Geocoding, wherein location entities in an article are disambiguated based on a language independent supervised classification engine.
    \item Effective uncertainty estimation for text classification using Metric learning and Dropout based ensemble modeling.
    \item Unsupervised rule based extraction of semantic information of type \textless \textit{actor, target, type, location, date}\textgreater~from text using universal dependency parsing and multilingual wordnet.
\end{itemize}
